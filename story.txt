A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
	there was a dark lord who wanted to rule the world
		However, there was a prophecy, that a child born in july would bring him to his downfall
	So during the warm summer month of july, the dark lord savagely murdered every child that was born,

	EXCEPT, our hero of course, john mcgee survived this horrific disaster. This was because his mom 
	was a powerful witch that put a spell on him to protect him so powerful that he received 
	only a small scar compared to losing his life

	He grew up not knowing his heritage or his importance, and at the young age of 11 he was enrolled
	in a school for people with magical abilities


	only problem
