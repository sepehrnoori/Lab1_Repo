A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
	there was a dark lord who wanted to rule the world
		However, there was a prophecy, that a child born in july would bring him to his downfall
	So during the warm summer month of july, the dark lord savagely murdered every child that was born,

	EXCEPT, our hero of course, john mcgee
